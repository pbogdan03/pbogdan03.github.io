This is my first post using Jekyll and Github Pages. It is more of an experimental page
so don't fret if you see some mistakes, just point them out if you want.

I will write here my thoughts on experiencing the physical world through digital things. Digital architecture, the brick and mortar one :)

Happy reading!
